                     Hi, my name is Louie. I am a second year Game Design and Development major. Among my interests are learning about history (especially medieval things), drawing, thinking of game concepts, and as of recently- 3d modeling and animation. From this course, I hope to gain the skills to build an online portfolio for potential employers to view my work. From my major, I want to be able to design and publish a game from the ground up and get feedback from as many peers and professors as possible. In the future, I would like to work for Ubisoft because I play their games most often. 
                </p>
