        <h2>Trivia (Stefán Karl Stefánsson Tribute)</h2>
        <p>
            From <em>Trivia</em> section of <em>MobyGames</em> information about For Honor:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            The game pays tribute to voice actor Stefán Karl Stefánsson, who contributed to the game's Icelandic voice talent and was better known for 
            his role as villain Robbie Rotten on children's TV programme LazyTown, where the song "We Are Number One" became a popular internet meme. 
            The tribute in question is a special statue called "Number One" and captioned "In Memoriam – To our Number One villain".

        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>
            From <em>The Guardian's</em> review of For Honor:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            For Honor exhibits an extraordinary purity of vision – the result perhaps of designer Jason VandenBerghe’s 10-year quest to get it made. 
            It is therefore a fascinating game for people who take the fighting genre seriously. It isn’t a brawler, it isn’t Street Fighter and it isn’t Mount and Blade – 
            it exists somewhere between all three, and it demands that players develop a broad range of skills to master its armoury.
            You will enjoy For Honor more if you can form a clan with friends and support each other properly, but even for casual swordsmen and swordswomen it has much to offer.
